# Insert and shift middle index of array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This is the second code challenge of Javascript 401 that requires us to shift around values in an array without using built in methods

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Given and array and value, insert value into the middle index of the array and return array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We created a seperate array and pushed the first half of values into it and then added the given value. We then finished by filling in the rest of the array.
