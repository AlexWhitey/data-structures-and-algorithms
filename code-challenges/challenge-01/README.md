<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This challenge was to take in an array and return a reversed version


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Gregory and I both agreed that we thought a for loop would be best for this function. We decided that because it was logical to take a value at each index.
