# FIFO Animal Shelter

[PR](https://github.com/alex-white-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/7)

## Feature Tasks
* Create a class called `AnimalShelter` which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
  * `enqueue(animal)`: adds `animal` to the shelter. `animal` can be either a dog or a cat object.
  * `dequeue(pref)`: returns either a dog or a cat. If `pref` is not `"dog"` or `"cat"` then return null.
